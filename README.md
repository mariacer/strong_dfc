# Deep Feedback Control

Implementation of Deep Feedback Control and some extensions. The basis of this repository is a cleaned-up version of this 
[public repository](https://github.com/meulemansalex/deep_feedback_control/tree/main).

## Requirements

The necessary conda environment to run the code is provided in the file [dfc_environment.yml](dfc_environment.yml). To generate the environment type `conda env create -f dfc_environment.yml` and activate it with `conda activate dfc_environment`.

Note that you'll also need to install the [hypnettorch library](https://github.com/chrhenning/hypnettorch) by doing `python3 -m pip install hypnettorch`.

## Documentation

How to open the documentation is explained in the `docs` folder.

## Running experiments

For running experiments, move to the `dfc` subfolder. Further instructions can be found on the [README](dfc/README.rst) there. Command line arguments with good hyperparameter settings for the different DFC variants can be found in the [EXPERIMENTS.rst](dfc/EXPERIMENTS.rst) file.
